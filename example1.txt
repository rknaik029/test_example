#command for folling git and git hub


1. 1st step we need to creete a ssh key

using : ssh-keygen -t -rsa -b 4096 -C "@mail.com"

next go the 

cat id_rsa.pub

key will display on terminal and copy it.

next go the git hub portal and select the setting ---->SSH KEY -----> cREAT A NAME OF THE KEY -----> put the ssh-key and past it ---->add the key succesfully


after that we need create resopsitory ----> name of repo----->go to code ( green box) -----> copy ssh address url 


next to be go the terminal 

git clone <ssh url>


press the enter


it done on clone to local repo 


so adding the file and write some code on using vi or txt file whatver we want 


so next to use 

git init (inialization)
git add <filename>

git commit -m "test"

git push --set-upstram or git push

next to check in git hub file will be visible 


and next to create a brach 

we are creating branch for main file should not be modified we need create a new branch 


git branch

*main or *master 


then we be done 


git branch "dev01" -----> branch is created  

git status -----> check the status brach create or not ?


once branch created we switch the branch.


git switch <branch name>


once branch swithed afterthat whatever main brach file is availabe and all file copied  to created branch (new barnch)

go to github check there brach is cretared or not ?


so after created brach so we can write a code and we can ----->git add . ---->git commit -m "comment"------>git push----->after that ----->pull and and merged the file into main branch or master barch.
